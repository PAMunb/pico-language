PicoVM is an assembly PICO VM written in C99.

To compile, type:
make

PicoVM syntax:
picovm [-v] [-g] [-i input.asm]
       -v              Enables verbose.
       -g              Enables interactive mode (use with -i).
       -i file_name... Execute instructions from file, instead of stdin.

The format of input file includes intructions that are comma
separated, one per line, being the latest instruction without comma. Eg.

pushNat(10),
pushNat(5),
sub2()

No comments ('//' nor '#') or nothing beyond this strict definition
will be accepted, as the ad-hoc parser is still very weak.
